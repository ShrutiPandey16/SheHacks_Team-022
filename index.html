      <h1>Timeline</h1>
      <p>Joanne Rowling was born on 31st July 1965 at Yate General Hospital near Bristol, and grew up in Gloucestershire
        in England and in Chepstow, Gwent, in south-east Wales. <br>
        Her father, Peter, was an aircraft engineer at the Rolls Royce factory in Bristol and her mother, Anne, was a
        science technician in the Chemistry department at Wyedean Comprehensive,
        where Jo herself went to school. Anne was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis when Jo was a teenager and died in
        1990, before the Harry Potter books were published. Jo also has a
        younger sister, Di. <br> The young Jo grew up surrounded by books. “I lived for books,’’ she has said. “I was
        your basic common-or-garden bookworm, complete with freckles and National
        Health spectacles.” <br> In Edinburgh, Jo trained as a teacher and began teaching in the city’s schools, but she
        continued to write in every spare moment. Having completed the full manuscript,
        , "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's stone", she sent the first three chapters to a number of literary agents,
        one of whom wrote back asking to see the rest of it. She says it was “the best letter I had ever received in my
        life.”
        The book was first published by Bloomsbury Children’s Books in June 1997, under the name J.K. Rowling.

      <h1>Recent Events</h1>
      <p>However, Part 8 of the <em>Harry Potter</em> series was published in the year 2016, but potter heads were
        eagerly waiting for the movie which got hindered due to Covid-19 pandemic.J.K. Rowling and Warner Bros have made
        it pretty clear that there are presently no plans for Harry Potter and the Cursed Child to be made into a movie.
        In early 2017, a rumor began circulating that there was a plan to make a Harry Potter and the Cursed Child movie
        years from now, when the original Harry Potter stars were close to the age of their respective characters in the
        19-years-later setting of the play. Though the rumor seemed viable, given that it put plenty of distance between
        now and when this potential trilogy would take place, J.K. Rowling promptly shut down speculation on the idea,
        stating that it is "NO TRUTH" to the rumor. As there are no plans to adapt Harry Potter and the Cursed Child
        into a movie, there is no release date information to speak of. Instead, film fans will have to look forward to
        the next Fantastic Beasts film, the third in the series, which is currently slated for release on July 15th,
        2022.

  <div class="Topics-row" id="Inspiration">

    <h1>Inspiration</h1>
    <p>No success story begins in victory. It was after many rejections that Rowling got a publisher to accept her work,
      but it came at a cost. She was asked to change her name, as the publishers believed that a book written by a woman
      would not appeal to readers.
      The story of J.K. Rowling reflects the break-points that women go through, although the stories of every
      individual is different in achieving success but what leaves behind is the experience and true essence to chase
      your own dreams. Following are the things
      that J.K. Rowling adopted and inspired others especially set an example in front of the audience on behalf of
      entire women group...
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Keep your dreams alive</strong>- The matter of concern is not who comes in your way but the way you
        deal with the obstacles and how crazy you are to accomplish the thing you dreamt of over the years. </li>
      <li><strong>Always have an Opinion</strong>- When you are involved in a conversation, it is not necessary to agree
        with each and every point that the other person is agreeing too. It is important to have a perception in a right
        direction which helps one
        thinking in various forms and gather the related possibilities. </li>
      <li><strong>“It is our choices … that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.”</strong>-This awesome
        single quote is an answer to many questions. </li>
      <li><strong>The biggest lesson one can learn from J.K Rowling is to keep trying, believing, and acting on your
          dream. Whether it’s to become a successful entrepreneur or to publish a book.</strong></li>
